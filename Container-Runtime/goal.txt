1. Mini Container Runtime
Linux concepts: namespaces, cgroups, chroot, pivot_root, seccomp, capabilities

What to build:

A lightweight version of Docker written in Go or C.

It should isolate processes using clone() with CLONE_NEWUTS, CLONE_NEWPID, CLONE_NEWNS, etc.

Apply cgroups to limit CPU/memory usage.

Launch a bash shell inside an isolated environment.

Why it’s cool: You’ll deeply understand how containers actually work under the hood.
